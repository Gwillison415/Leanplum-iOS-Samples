//(Optional) You may choose to enable the Remote Notifications background mode on iOS 7+ to preload the notification action. This is configurable in your XCode project settings > Capabilities > Background Modes. If you have this enabled, you must tell Leanplum to explicitly handle notifications in your app delegate:

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler
{
    [Leanplum handleNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
